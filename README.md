## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/downloads/) (v2201.8.3 or later recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) (for PostgreSQL)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Backend Setup (Ballerina)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnklakshan/iwb25-445-justfortry.git
cd iwb25-445-justfortry
```

#### 2. Set Up the Database Using Docker

Start a PostgreSQL container with Docker:

```bash
docker pull postgres:latest

# Run the PostgreSQL container (update credentials as needed)
docker run --name personal-finance-db \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=personal_finance_db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=finance_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=finance_pass \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:latest
```

- This will start PostgreSQL on port 5432 with database `personal_finance_db`, user `finance_user`, and password `finance_pass`.

#### 3. Configure the Ballerina Backend

- Navigate to the backend directory (update the path if different):

  ```bash
  cd backend
  ```

- Update the configuration file (`Config.toml` or `config.json`) with your PostgreSQL credentials:

  ```toml
  [database]
  host = "localhost"
  port = 5432
  user = "finance_user"
  password = "finance_pass"
  database = "personal_finance_db"
  ```

#### 4. Run the Backend Service

```bash
bal run
```

- The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

**Database Management:**
- Stop database: `docker stop personal-finance-db`
- Start database: `docker start personal-finance-db`

---

### Frontend Setup (TypeScript)

#### 1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### 3. Run the Frontend Application

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

- The frontend app will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Usage

2. Register or log in (if authentication is enabled).
3. Start adding your income and expense transactions.
4. Explore the dashboard for insights and manage your budgets!
